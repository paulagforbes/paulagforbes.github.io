When we encounter difficult or threatening situations, such as an important job interview or a tough exam, we often experience stress. This is characterised by a cascade of biological changes in our brains and bodies. Using a range of behavioural and physiological methods, I explore how these changes impact people's decisions and social behaviour. For example, why do some people eat more unhealthily when stressed? Does stress change our motivation to help others? How can we make better decisions under stress?
